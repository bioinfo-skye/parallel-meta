# Introduction

Parallel-META is a comprehensive and full-automatic computational toolkit for rapid data mining among metagenomic datasets, with advanced features including sequence profiling and OTU picking, rRNA copy number calibration, functional prediction, diversity statistics, bio-marker selection, interaction network construction, vector-graph-based visualization and parallel computing. Both metagenomic shotgun sequences and 16S/18S rRNA amplicon sequences are accepted.

Based on parallel algorithms and optimizations, Parallel-META 3 can achieve a very high speed compare to traditional microbiome analysis pipelines.

We strongly recommend that read this manually carefully before use ParallelMETA 3.

# Download
	
The latest release is available at:

http://bioinfo.single-cell.cn/parallel-meta.html

# Packages

## Executive binary package:

Parallel-META 3 executive binary package integrated with all tools is available for Linux and Mac OS X.

## Source code package:

Parallel-META 3 source code package is also available for building and installation for other Unix/Linux based operating systems.

# Dependency

## OpenMP

OpenMP library is the C/C++ parallel computing library. Most Linux releases have OpenMP already been installed in the system. In Mac OS X, to install the compiler that supports OpenMP, we recommend using the Homebrew package manager:

	brew install gcc

## Rscript environment

For statistical analysis and pdf format output, Parallel-META 3 requires cran-R (<http://cran.r-project.org/>) 3.2 or higher for the execution of “.R” scripts. Then all packages could be automatically installed and updated by the Parallel-META 3 installer.

## Vsearch (included in the package)
Vsearch has been integrated in the package. If you want to install/update manually, please download from
https://sourceforge.net/projects/vsearch/
and put the “vsearch”to $ParallelMETA/Aligner/bin/.

## HMMER 3 (3.0 or higher, included in the package)

HMMER3 has been integrated in the package. If you want to install/update manually, please download from

<http://www.hmmer.org/download.html>

and put the “hmmsearch” to $ParallelMETA/HMMER/bin/.

# Installation

## Automatic installation (recommended)

Now the Parallel-META provides a fully automatic installer for easy installation.

a. Extract the package:

	tar –xzvf parallel-meta-3.tar.gz

b. Install
	
	cd parallel-meta
	source install.sh

### Tips for the Automatic installation

1. Please “cd parallel-meta” directory before run the automatic installer.
2. The automatic installer only configures the environment variables to the default configuration files of “\~/.bashrc” or “\~/.bash_profile”. If you want to configure the environment variables to other configuration file please use the manual installation.
3. If the automatic installer failed, Parallel-META 3 can still be installed manually by the following steps.

## Manual installation

If the automatic installer failed, Parallel-META 3 can still be installed manually.

a. Extract the package:

	tar –xzvf parallel-meta-3.tar.gz

b. Configure the environment variables (default environment variable configuration file is located at “\~/.bashrc” or “\~/.bash_profile”)

	export ParallelMETA=Path to Parallel-META 3
	export PATH=”$PATH:$ParallelMETA/bin”
	source ~/.bashrc

c. Install R packages
	
	Rscript $ParallelMETA/Rscript/config.R

d. Compile the source code* (only required by the source code package):

	cd parallel-meta
	make

# Notice before start to use

1. The output path should NOT be the same path as the input file for the output path will be CLEARED initially. Make sure Parallel-META 3 has the write permission of the output path.
2. We strongly recommend to read this manually carefully before use ParallelMETA 3.

# Tools in toolkit

Tools can be directly used as Linux command line with parameters. To see all available parameters, please run the command with parameter ‘-h’, eg.

	PM-pipeline –h

in which “list.txt” is the path of N samples’ taxonomical analysis results, and each sample in one line (see Sample list format).

The PM-update-taxa will replace the previous analysis results in “classification.txt”, and backup previous file named “classification.txt.bk”. This update will significantly improve the taxonomy annotation on Genus level, so we strongly command to re-run the pipeline. This update will not affect the results of functional analysis.

# Formats

## Sequence format and sequence list

Usually Parallel-META 3 accepts split sequences that each sample is in one single Fasta/Fastq file. For Fasta/Fastq format, sample ID should not contain space symbol (‘ ‘) and table symbol (‘\t’), and each sequence is in 1 single line. For 16S rRNA sequences, Parallel-META 3 support pair-ended sequences (-R), and for metagenomic shotgun sequences Parallel-META 3 only support single-ended sequences

For PM-pipeline, input path of all input samples (pairs) should be contained in the sequence list. In the sequence list:

**Single-ended sequences:** each sample has one single line for one Fasta/Fastaq file, such as:

	/home/data/sample1.fasta
	/home/data/sample2.fasta
	/home/data/sample3.fasta

**Pair-ended sequences:** each sample has two lines for pair-1 sequences and pair-2 sequences in Fasta/Fastq format, such as:

	/home/data/sample1_pair1.fasta
	/home/data/sample1_pair2.fasta
	/home/data/sample2_pair1.fasta
	/home/data/sample2_pair2.fasta
	/home/data/sample3_pair1.fasta
	/home/data/sample3_pair2.fasta
	/home/data/sample4_pair1.fasta
	/home/data/sample4_pair2.fasta

**Integrated sequences:** In addition, Parallel-META 3 also supports integrated Fasta/Fastq with barcode or group information (Mothur format) or in QIIME format. The integrated sequences should be split by PM-split-seq before the analysis starts, and PM-split-seq can also automatically make the sequence list for all samples.

The barcode file format:

	ATTCGT Sample1
	AGCGTC Sample2
	……
	CGTGAC SampleN

The group file format:

	Seq_Id_1 Sample1
	Seq_Id_2 Sample2
	……
	Seq_Id_N SampleN

## Meta-data format (usually for –m)

In the meta-data file, each row represents one sample and each column represents one feature. Input samples should have the same order in meta-data file and sample list file. Sample IDs should not be started with number and symbol ‘#’, and should not contain space symbol (‘ ’), backslash symbol (‘/’) and table symbol (‘\t’).

Example:

	SampleID	Habitat		Sex	Host
	Sample1		Palm		M	H1
	Sample2		Oral		F	H2
	Sample3		Gut		M	H1
	Sample4		Gut		F	H3

## Single sample profile list format (usually for –l)

In the single sample profile list, each row represents one sample, with sample ID and path to its profiling result by PM-parallel-meta.

Example:

	Sample1	/home/data/results1/classification.txt
	Sample2	/home/data/results2/classification.txt
	Sample3	/home/data/results3/classification.txt

The path could be either absolute path or relative path. For relative path, the prefix can be assigned by parameter –p.

## Abundance table (OTU table) format (usually for –T)

In the abundance table, each row represents one sample, and each column represents the absolute sequence count (*.Count) or the relative abundance (*.Abd) of a sample on one community feature (eg. OTU or taxa).

Example:

	SampleID	OTU_1	OTU_2	OTU_3
	Sample1		3	9	0
	Sample2		5	10	0
	Sample3		6	5	0
	Sample4		0	2	8

The OTU table can be generated by PM-select-taxa from the profiling results of PM-parallel-meta:

	PM-select-taxa –l list.txt –o taxa.txt –L 7

and the output taxa.OTU.Count is the OTU table with sequence count information. By OTU table, abundance tables on other taxonomy levels can be generated by PM-select-taxa (eg. Genus level):

	PM-select-taxa –T taxa.OTU.Count –o taxa.txt –L 6
